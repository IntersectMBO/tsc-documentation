| Topic                                   | Discussion                                                                                                                                                                         | Notes                                                                                                                                         |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Agenda Review & Prioritization          | Kevin opened the meeting, noting that Christian would attend only the first 30 minutes, Leo and Alonso were unable to join, and Ryan would be invited up to discuss testnets.      | Six TSC members were present, meeting the requirement for a quorum.                                                                           |
| Review of Action Items                  | Bosko shared the ClickUp list focusing on upcoming tasks, including post-quantum cryptography and practical parameters.                                                            | Kevin noted he reached out to the Cardano Over Coffee team regarding a budget breakdown session.                                              |
| Cardano Testnet Purpose Document        | Ryan presented a draft document defining the formal purposes, upgrade paths, and lifecycles (short-lived vs. long-lived) for testnets like Preview, Pre-Prod, Sancho, and Dripnet. | Neil and Kevin emphasized adding a clear upfront disclaimer that testnets are not for production and offer no uptime or stability guarantees. |
| Parameter Committee Update              | Alex gave an update on the successful Parliamentary Committee meeting and noted that the constitutional minimum size reduction proposal thresholds had been met.                   | A proposal to bundle a pool cost reduction (to 75) with a 25% Plutus memory unit limit increase is being drafted for Q3.                      |
| K=1000 Parameter & Info Action          | The Parameter Committee decided to present a side-by-side pro/con view for K=1000 to educate DREPs rather than endorsing a stance.                                                 | An "Info Action" (via SIP-179 tooling) will be launched to gather specific, unambiguous feedback from SPOs.                                   |
| Second\_fi Incident Status Report       | Kevin provided a public update regarding Second\_fi and the CTRL wallet ceasing operations. Security Council has submitted forensic questions to the auditor via Emurgo.           | Users are strongly encouraged to strictly follow the official Emurgo automated recovery processes to avoid losing funds.                      |
| Daedalus Wallet Support                 | Kevin highlighted the importance of supporting open-source, full-node wallets like Daedalus.                                                                                       | A Twitter thread in support of the Daedalus wallet has been drafted and will be published in a few days.                                      |
| Babbage/Chang Hard Fork Ledger Behavior | Ryan (Cerkoryn) explained a critical ledger design rule: if a governance action expires in the same epoch a hard fork is ratified, it is dropped even if passing.                  | Kevin clarified that this is intentional ledger design behavior to prevent rule misalignment, not a bug.                                      |
| On-Chain Proposals At Risk              | If the hard fork ratifies immediately, the Hydra proposal and Committee Minimum Size parameter risk being dropped.                                                                 | An urgent call to action was issued for DREPs and ADA holders to vote immediately, particularly on the Ikigai proposal.                       |
| Dijkstra Hard Fork Planning             | The upcoming Working Group meeting on July 9th at 14:00 UTC will be dedicated to scoping out the complex Dykstra hard fork.                                                        | The Product Committee has been manually invited. This hard fork will involve constitutional amendments and guardrail script changes.          |
| 2026 TSC Budget Proposal                | The on-chain budget proposal sits at \~35% support, short of the 67% needed before the July 23rd expiry date.                                                                      | A communications push is planned, including an Intersect blog post and a Cardano Over Coffee slot on July 16th at 15:00 UTC.                  |
| Linear Leios Response                   | Neil reported that the vendor response regarding linear leios failed to answer any of their direct technical tracking questions.                                                   | Neil and Kevin will take this conversation offline to figure out how to engage the right engineering contacts.                                |
| Post-Quantum Cryptography               | The committee briefly discussed a Linux Foundation report shared in the chat. The material focuses on the vulnerability of cryptographic primitives.                               | Neil noted the need to refocus the material specifically on blockchain blast radiuses, PR/FUD management, and educational hurdles.            |
