## Decisions/Actions

**Decisions**

* Closure of Working Group: The Technical Steering Committee formally voted to close the Chain Incident Working Group as the report is now finalized.

* Hard Fork Naming: The name "van Rossem" was confirmed and the info action has been submitted on-chain.
* Report Finalization: Version 0.5 of the Chain Incident Report (dated the previous Friday) was approved as the final factual version, with no further changes to be made by the TSC.
* Security Appointment: Mike was officially appointed and onboarded as the Security Incident Response Officer.

**Actions**

* Kevin: Follow up with Alex via Slack to confirm if the blog post regarding the Constitution Committee size has been published.
* Kevin: Apply additional pressure to the Intersect Executive and Board to ensure the timely release of the Chain Incident Report.
* Ryan: Perform detailed mathematical analysis on how much stake needs to move to smaller pools to make them viable under the proposed K=1,000 change.
* Kevin: Schedule a "pre-meeting" for the TSC small group to align on KPI criticisms before the joint session with the Product Committee next Tuesday.
* TSC Members: Download and save a PDF copy of the finalized Chain Incident Report (v0.5) for personal records to ensure no unauthorized changes are made during the legal review.
* TSC Members: Review the 2025 Foundational Research and Technology Validation reports provided by Fergie and provide feedback by January 23rd.
* Nicolas: Act as the primary proxy/point of contact for any technical questions regarding the IOG research papers.
* Kevin: Organize a separate session to progress the TSC Operational Budget proposal
* Bosko: Reconcile calendars to potentially move the Hard Fork Working Group meeting time to better align with IO's internal node meetings.

| Parameter K to 1,000        | Ryan presented benefits of increasing K (Nakamoto coefficient, pledge viability). Neil challenged the assumption that it automatically helps struggling small pools.                    | Ryan to provide more detailed arithmetic/math on stake movement for the next meeting.                                                            |
| Min Pool Cost Reduction     | Ryan proposed lowering minPoolCost from 170 to 75 ADA to prevent delegator rewards from being eaten by the "first block tax" as rewards decrease.                                       | Long-term solution: Moving toward SIP-23 (min pool margin) in the Dykstra hard fork (v12).                                                       |
