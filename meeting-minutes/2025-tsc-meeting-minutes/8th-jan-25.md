| Plomin Hard Fork Update             | Latest version of Node now ready for release 10.1.4                                                                                 | Recommendation for all SPOS and relays to upgrade to node version 10.1.4. - KH to update Comms            |
| Node Version Protocol Clarification | Clarified that node version 10.1.4 does not change the protocol version but enables readiness for version 10 with added safeguards. | Ensure significant majority of nodes are upgraded before the hard fork. Update release notes accordingly. |
| Community Member Testing            | Recognition that some members of the community have made during testing phase ahead of Plomin HF                                    | Public acknowledgment planned for contributors going forward. Explore establishing a bug bounty program.  |
| Hard Fork Readiness Metrics         | Agreement on importance of transparency  in communication to ensure at least 80% node upgrade before the fork.                      | Update communications to emphasize urgency and potential risks of not upgrading.                          |
| Maintenance of Tooling              | Proposal to support widely used open-source tools like Lucid and Coyos with maintenance funding.                                    | Aligns with existing working groups to triage and prioritize funding needs for critical tools.            |
| Maintenance Contract with IO        | Progress on defining business terms, fiscal audit processes, and reporting requirements.                                            | Finalize business terms by end of the week and submit to Intersect for legal processing.                  |
| Tooling Working Group Proposal      | Discussion on whether TSC or OSC should manage this initiative and ensure cross-disciplinary collaboration.                         | Proposal for OSC to lead, with TSC and Product Committee involvement for prioritization and oversight.    |
| Release Note Updates                | Current notes were vague and caused community confusion. Revised to clarify urgency and rationale for upgrades.                     | Updated release notes to specify potential DOS risks mitigated by node version 10.1.4.                    |
