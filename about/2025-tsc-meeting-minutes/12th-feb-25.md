## Decisions:

1. Scope and refine the Cardano Blueprint documentation project: The TSC decided to move forward with this project but with a greater focus on identifying user needs, surveying developers, and setting clear deliverables. This includes potentially exploring executable specifications.
2. Investigate AWS cost breakdown: The TSC wants more detailed information about the AWS costs, breaking them down by service and usage. This is in response to community concerns about the high AWS expenditure.
3. Take on maintenance of the Cardano node emulator: The TSC agreed that maintaining this tool is important and will review the statement of work provided by Nicholas.
