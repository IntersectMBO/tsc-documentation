* Maintenance Contract Priorities: While the main discussion on Maintenance Contract Priorities was tabled, with a vote to happen asynchronously on Friday, a secondary motion was passed. It was decided to formally recognize the efforts of Mike Horn and Carl Kitson for their contributions to handling the potential Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability.
* Slack vs. Discord: The TSC decided to fund Slack licenses for its members instead of migrating to Discord. This decision was made due to security concerns and the preference for Slack's interface and notification system.

It's important to note that some agenda items were discussed but didn't result in immediate decisions:

* MSA Review: The discussion prompted action to confirm with the IE team regarding the terms of the MSA.
* Product Committee Road Map: TSC members were asked to review the roadmap and provide feedback by the following week.
* IOI Maintenance Contract Update: Neil and Adam were tasked with reviewing the contract and providing feedback.
* Recognition: A broader discussion about recognizing TSC contributors led to the specific decision mentioned above, but no formal process for recognition was established during the meeting.
* New Proposals Triage: The discussion acknowledged progress in the triaging process, but no specific decisions were made about individual proposals.
