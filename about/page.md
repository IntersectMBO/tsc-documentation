# Evalution Criteria

{% file src="../.gitbook/assets/TSC Evaluation Criteria for Core Projects July 2025.pdf" %}

**Scope:** Continuity of Cardano

**Definitions:**&#x20;

* Continuity is the unbroken and consistent existence or operation of something over time.
* Cardano “Continuity” is defined as any approved technical services needed to build or fix current and future areas of the Cardano blockchain.&#x20;
* Continuity in this definition can include new development, such as the CIP-1694 governance software, upgrades to components or improvements in testing.

To further help this definition we have outlined specific areas which would fall under consideration for TSC endorsement, funding and deliver: Cardano Maintenance, Cardano Development, Market Drivers and Appeal.

At any given time the scope under delivery of the TSC will incorporate these elements. The total makeup of scope will vary over time, with those nearer the core having weighted priority.
