# Technical Steering Committee (TSC)

## What is the Technical Steering Committee?

The Technical Steering Committee (TSC) ensures that the governance of Cardano is based upon sound technical awareness and best practices. The committee's duties are expected to include:&#x20;

* Facilitating delivery & technical assurance from [continuity delivery partners](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/cardano-continuity) and suppliers
* Coordination of major integrations and technical events, such as hard forks
* Facilitating peer review of technical recommendations from other committees, such as Open Source & the Parameter committee
* Recommending the execution details of the backlog (backlog currently under design from the [Ecosystem Process Design working group](https://app.gitbook.com/o/Prbm1mtkwSsGWSvG1Bfd/s/K7cBOo8O1BpQ2uwlq0BE/))
* Drafting of milestone deliverables, acceptance criteria, and quality assurance for the execution recommendation
* Facilitating a tender/award process for major contracts with members
* Coordination of working groups focused on the above

## Why is this committee important?

The committee is a rallying point for key members, suppliers, and third parties to coordinate the delivery of development services to support the Cardano blockchain. The committee facilitates contract arrangements and service level agreements, creates proposals of technical concern, and reviews, and evaluates proposals prepared by the Cardano community, such as parameter updates or hard forks.&#x20;

## Which topics does this committee cover?

The TSC takes a leading role in defining and advising on [Cardano continuity](https://app.gitbook.com/s/o50OuflyxfUMOt8hHPn2/intersect-overview/working-on-cardano) development to support the Cardano network, including contracts and agreements with Intersect members. It’s a highly technocratic committee, providing deep technical analysis and advice to ongoing development projects, parameters settings (through the [Parameter Committee](https://app.gitbook.com/s/o50OuflyxfUMOt8hHPn2/intersect-overview/intersect-committees/technical-steering-committee-tsc/parameter-committee-pc)), and any other network related conditions.

It is proposed the TSC will work in conjunction with the [budget committee](https://app.gitbook.com/o/Prbm1mtkwSsGWSvG1Bfd/s/gsGMUGjBGIwHbN0vrf7v/) for budgetary assignment, ratification, and other financial matters. It is also proposed the TSC will work in combination with the proposed backlog committee, under the premise of the backlog committee being responsible for the ‘what’, and the TSC for the ‘how’.

The membership of the TSC will need to consider how it handles sensitive or confidential contractual information. It will also need to define how it handles sensitive security information.

## Agenda&#x20;

In the current interim phase, under the stewardship of the [delivery assurance team](https://app.gitbook.com/s/o50OuflyxfUMOt8hHPn2/intersect-operational-services/intersect-operational-services-overview/managing-delivery-partners) the TSC holds a rolling agenda on the following;

* Welcome to the Committee/Introductions as required
* Delivery Update (upcoming and significant delivery milestones)
* Actions review of the TSC
* Updates from Working Groups
* AOB

The committee observes Intersect's Membership Code of Conduct.
