# How to Participate in Shaping the Technical Roadmap

Your input is crucial in determining the direction of Cardano's development for 2025 and beyond. By participating, you help prioritize what‚Äôs most important and ensure that we are addressing the needs of the Cardano community. Here‚Äôs how you can get involved and contribute effectively to the roadmap.

***

### **Step 1: Understand the Product Goals**

Our product goals are the foundation for shaping future projects. We recommend starting by familiarizing yourself with these goals.\
üëâ **Read more about the Product Committee and its goals** [**here**](https://committees.docs.intersectmbo.org/intersect-product-committee/committee-outcomes/2025-cardanos-roadmap)

***

### **Step 2: Proposal Review Body (PRB)**

{% hint style="info" %}
In 2024 the [CIR](https://committees.docs.intersectmbo.org/intersect-product-committee/working-group/core-infrastructure-roadmap-working-group) group worked to create a backlog of potential projects, many of which can be seen on the subsequent [Potential Roadmap Projects](https://committees.docs.intersectmbo.org/intersect-technical-steering-committee/technical-roadmap/potential-roadmap-projects) list. In 2025, understanding a need to further industrialise this process, the Product Committee, TSC and Open Source Committee are now jointly tasked with reviewing project submission, readiness and allocation between the committees.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

At any given time two elected committee members, from each of the Product Committee, Technical Steering Committee and Open Source Committee will contribute to the Proposal Review Body.\
üëâ I**nformation on the new PRB group and its processes will be available soon**

### **Step 3: Submit Your Proposal**

Ready to suggest a new project or initiative? Complete the submission form to propose your idea. Your submission will be triaged by the Proposal Review Body and evaluated by the relevant committee, such as the Technical Steering Committee (TSC), Product Committee (PC) or Open Source Committee (OSC)\
üëâ **Complete the submission form** [**here**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdD6vCGq1oQ3eSa3tOKN1DB3MJaMxs96zXqKp8v1ghHw6tceQ/viewform?vc=0\&c=0\&w=1\&flr=0)\

Ensure your proposal clearly outlines your idea, its relevance to one or more Product goals, and any necessary technical details. Full instructions are included in the form to help guide you through the process.

### **Step 4: Track Your Proposal‚Äôs Progress**

Once your proposal is submitted and reviewed, it will be available for the community to follow. You can track its progress via the **Proposal Cards** page, where all reviewed proposals are listed as proposal cards.\
üëâ **View all the proposal cards** [**here**](potential-roadmap-projects.md)

### **Step 5: Engage in Discussions**

Join the ongoing conversations around these projects and goals. We hold regular Q\&A sessions where you can voice your thoughts, ask questions, and provide feedback on specific proposals.\
üëâ **Check the schedule and join the discussion on Luma or Discord (**[**Events List**](https://discord.com/channels/1136727663583698984/1243498043676819498)**)**
