# How to Participate in Shaping the Technical Roadmap

Your input is crucial in determining the direction of Cardano's development for 2025 and beyond. By participating, you help prioritize what’s most important and ensure that we are addressing the needs of the Cardano community. Here’s how you can get involved and contribute effectively to the roadmap.

### **Step 1: Understand the Product Goals**

Our product goals are the foundation for shaping future projects. We recommend starting by familiarizing yourself with these goals.\

The CIR process is your pathway for submitting new project proposals. Our team will review and triage all submissions, passing them to the relevant committees for evaluation.\
