# Technical Roadmap Explained

### Journey so far

The [Product Committee](https://committees.docs.intersectmbo.org/intersect-product-committee), has been holding open sessions to discuss and formulate high level goals for Cardano.

In 2024 the [Core Infrastructure Roadmap](https://committees.docs.intersectmbo.org/intersect-product-committee/working-group/core-infrastructure-roadmap-working-group) (CIR), with contributions by the community and [technical working groups](https://committees.docs.intersectmbo.org/groups-overview/technical-working-groups), have been defining process for collating potential roadmap items - you can read about the work to date on the [knowledge base](https://committees.docs.intersectmbo.org/intersect-product-committee/working-group/core-infrastructure-roadmap-working-group/working-group-milestones-and-meeting-schedule). In the early part of 2025, to industrialise previous processes, a Proposal Review Body (PRB) has been formed. This group has started to look at a wider remit of projects spanning the Technical Steering, Product and Open Source Committees. Two elected members of each committee above come together to form the PRB.

The PRB reviews proposals submitted and allocates them to the most appropriate committee for progression as required in prioritization, budget and tendering activities.

These goals from the Product Committee and potential projects submitted are linked. Goals and projects which receive higher levels of support, _prioritization by the community,_ are likely to be put forward for earlier inclusion in the budget.&#x20;

Exceptions and caveats always exist, to ensure we maintain a secure, stable end product which delivers value.

### Ways to participate!

Whilst we have taken care to signpost opportunities to join the discussion on product goals and to submit potential projects for review by the CIR we understand that this may not be enough. Both of these processes are envisaged as being continuous, you can contribute by following the details below:

### Prioritisation - how does it work

We will introduce you to a number of the goals defined by the product committee, the goals which have a strong alignment a potential technical roadmap.

We will then introduce the projects which likely support these goals, which are likely to contribute to the desired goal outcomes in 2025 and beyond.

Why only likely?

Nobody can guarantee outcomes. Projects have risks, some known and some unknown. However, we believe these are projects which could contribute to the desired goal outcomes.

This is a **continuous** process, with prioritization opportunities throughout any given year. The review processes implemented by the CIR group will continue to review and add potential projects to the backlog throughout 2025 and beyond.

The community is asked to participate in feedback and prioritization on the potential projects. **Participate in the prioritization survey** [**here**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1aGwaVxHyI3vMX3UxQ2PKLxr1rVbprZ1K2735YcIAjH4)**.**

### Technical Steering

Once the goals and the projects have been prioritized then the [Technical Steering Committee](https://committees.docs.intersectmbo.org/intersect-technical-steering-committee) will recommend how best to implement them and oversee the technical delivery supported by Intersect delivery assurance teams.&#x20;

The TSC is a rallying point for members, suppliers, and third parties to coordinate the delivery of development services to support the Cardano blockchain.&#x20;

* Recommending the execution details of the backlog&#x20;
* Drafting of milestone deliverables, acceptance criteria, and quality assurance for the execution recommendation
* Facilitating a tender/award process for major contracts with members

Although not seen as primary decision factor it may not be possible to finalise low level work package prioritisation until project tendering and procurement - you can read about those processes [here ](https://committees.docs.intersectmbo.org/intersect-budget-committee/standards-operational-procedures/intersects-contract-management-process)- in which case the TSC will recommend any final decisions as per their committee remit, this will become public following any responsible disclosure requirements.&#x20;
